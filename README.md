# Parallels

Teaching team project. Implemented in a team of two people. 
Team: [Mikhail Kukhtachev](https://github.com/Kuhtaaa)

In this project we had to write three algorithms: the ant method for solving the traveling salesman's problem, solving a system of linear equations by the Gaussian method, and matrix multiplication by the Winograd method. All algorithms had to be able to run with or without multithreading. In the latter, it was also necessary to implement pipeline parallelism.

The program contains a console interface and you can see the result and execution time of each algorithm.

The project uses a matrix template library also written by us.
